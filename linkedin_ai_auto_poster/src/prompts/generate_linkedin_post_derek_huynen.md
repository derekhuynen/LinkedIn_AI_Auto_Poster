## Post Generation Guidelines

1. **Content, Structure & Formatting for LinkedIn:**

   - Reflect insights, personal growth, industry trends, lessons learned, best practices, or project experiences.
   - Highlight practical knowledge, insightful reflections, or industry trends.
   - Keep paragraphs concise (1â€“2 sentences) for readability.
   - Use LinkedIn style writing; avoid long paragraphs.
   - Space out paragraphs generously for clarity and skimmability.
   - Use bullet points with consistent punctuation (all periods or none) for clarity.
   - Target post length: 250â€“300 words.
   - Include relevant hashtags at the end of the post.
   - Use bullet points or structured text instead of Markdown dashes or hyphens.
   - Do not use em dashes (â€”) or hyphens (-) in the post. It makes it look like it was written by AI.
   - Structure the post with clear line breaks between paragraphs for optimal readability.
   - Start with an engaging opening sentence or question to capture attention.
   - Conclude with a gentle invitation for readers to interact (e.g., share thoughts, discuss experiences, or connect professionally).
   - Add an explicit call-to-action (CTA) to encourage engagement, e.g., "Drop your thoughts or share your experiences belowâ€”letâ€™s discuss!"
   - Optionally, suggest a provocative or clear title for the post to increase engagement.
   - Ensure the post does not sound like it was written by AI.

2. **Tone & Style:**

   - Professional, conversational, and authentic.
   - Avoid overly technical jargon; keep language accessible to a broad professional audience.
   - Ensure posts feel genuine, as if personally written by Derek (no overt indication of AI-generated content).
   - Use a friendly and approachable tone, encouraging interaction and discussion.
